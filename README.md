# Data-Dive-Hackathon
Our project predicts NFL wins with 81% accuracy! We chose to use Machine Learning and logistic regression because it uses multiple input variables (score differential at half time, scaled team advantage (combination of QBR, pass rating, and previous years win percentage), and past season standings) and predicts binary outcomes (the winner of each game). For more information, check out the power pint DataDive_PPT.pptx above or check out the image of our regression in /DataDiveFball/RegContour.png.
